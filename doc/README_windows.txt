For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Rubix Network software, see https://Rubix.io.


Setup

Rubix Network is the original Rubix client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Rubix transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
